Execute commands as root: doas

Command doas(1) is a sudo alternative ported from OpenBSD. It's ideal for single-user systems that don't require the elaborate features - and more complex configuration - of sudo.

Installation and configuration are performed  while login as root.

Install ...

# pkg install doas

A sample configuration exists at /usr/local/etc/doas.conf.sample.

Create the /usr/local/etc/doas.conf file ...

# touch /usr/local/etc/doas.conf

... Edit the freshly created file and grant (example) user foo the privileges of root ...

# permit nopass foo as root

... Save with CTRL+O and exit with CTRL+X ( or simple use the later adn the system will ask you if you want to save your change).

... Log out of the root account and log in as your regular user ( hee: foo)

Now I can run commands as my user that would normally require root ...

$ doas pkg install <some_package>

.. Et Voila!
